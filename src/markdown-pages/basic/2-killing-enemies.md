All players are “allied” with each other, so your unit will not automatically shoot your opponents units. This is by design. Don’t try to unally, the map won’t let you and you may be banned.

Being allied means that there is an extra layer of skill involved in killing your enemies. You have to press A (for Attack), then click on your opponent’s sniper to command your sniper to shoot theirs. This is called a lock, and is the only way to kill others.

Don’t shoot your teammates! Your score will be penalised and you aren’t really helping your team..

The easiest thing is to keep a lock once you’ve got it and wait until you either kill or get killed. This is called a nooblock (NL) since it’s commonly done by noobs. It’ll work occasionally but it isn’t that effective at higher levels of play.

We’ll get on to better ways of getting the kill in later sections.

    Something to consider: what happens if two players have each other NLed? The answer isn’t as simple as you might think, but you’ll have to wait for a more advanced section for an explanation!
